I'm interested in source control, but not exclusively. I mean, I'm interested in a lot of other things--it's not like I obsess over git commands, branches, merge requests and the like. For instance, I enjoy starting sentences with prepositions and I'm kind of a big oxford comma fan.

I'm looking to collaborate on using github as a means of communicating with other github users. Maybe once I figure out how to add collaborators to this repo I'll look forward to people leaving messages in this readme sort of like how the message wall feature worked in ye olde Facebook.


You can reach me here!
